## About The Project

I created this repository to provide a centralized guide for setting
up a Windows OS for development purposes.  
These instructions reflect my personal configuration choices and
preferences. Please note that I am not responsible for any issues
that may arise from downloading and installing the recommended
software. You can follow these instructions at your own risk.
Make sure you review and understand each step before proceeding.

## Getting Started

Here you can find the software, tools and configurations I use, with a focus on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

### Windows Configuration

#### Install WSL

The easiest way to install WSL is by running the command below in Commnand Prompt: 
```sh
wsl --install -d Ubuntu-24.04
```

You can also search for different Linux distributions available for WSL using the command below:
```sh
wsl --list --online
```
